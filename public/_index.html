                    <p>With over 10 years of experience in terminal operations, Pascal Brockmann focuses on strategic
                        management in terminal development, for example in the areas of automation, equipment
                        requirements planning and procurement, management processes and the digitalization of customer
                        communication.<br/> <br/>As an operations and IT consultant at HPC Hamburg Port Consulting, he
                        communicated his experience to mostly South American customers, but his expertise was also in
                        demand at the HHLA terminals in Odessa and Tallinn. Since 2018 he is now Director Operations at
                        HHLA International and is responsible for all operations and technical topics for HHLA’s
                        international terminals.</p>
